# Introducing Da-Pinchi, the Robolancer's 2024 Crescendo bot

## 2024 WORLD CHAMPIONS

*Some notes on our code*

- We use command-based programming with subsystems for our drivetrain, intake, and shooter (and LEDs for some reason) and have modes for differentiating between climb and shooting
- We use PhotonVision (see [hardware](https://github.com/RoboLancers/RoboLancers-Hardware) for more details) for game piece detection and april tags fused with odometry for localization.
- PathPlanner for making auto paths (including the legendary chaos autos)
- We have lobsters crawling in our code
- Our constants are gross, please don't ask about the cursed math we use or the random minus signs
