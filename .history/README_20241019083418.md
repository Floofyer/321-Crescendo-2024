# Introducing Da-Pinchi, the Robolancer's 2024 Crescendo bot

## 2024 WORLD CHAMPIONS

*Some notes on our code*

- We use vision data from PhotonVision (see [hardware](https://github.com/RoboLancers/RoboLancers-Hardware) for more details) fused with odometry for localization.
- PathPlanner for making auto paths (including the legendary chaos autos)
- We have modes for differentiating between climb and shooting
- We have lobsters crawling in our code
